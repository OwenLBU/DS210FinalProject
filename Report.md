# DS210FinalProject
I had decided to use a database of stable-coin cryptocurrency transactions in my project. I thought it would be interesting to analyze the the frequency of use by creating a network graph. My dataset origanally contained one million lines, where each line is compiled with two users represented by their blockchain address separated by commas. To be able to work with the data easier, I shortened the file to 1500 lines. Then I created an undirected graph of the co-occurrences where the vertices represent the addresses, and the edges represent the co-occurrences between them. An edge between two addresses means that they have at least one transaction with eachother. In this data set it is very common for an address to only have one interaction. 
In the centrality module, the centrality is represented using an adjacency list data structure. The Graph struct contains the number of vertices node_count, a vector of adjacency lists outeredges representing the edges leaving each vertex, a vector of vertex labels containing the node_labels of each vertex, and a hashmap called node_indices mapping vertex labels to their indices in node_indices. Within the the graph module is the compute_and_print_centralities method. It computes  the centrality of each vertex in the given graph then initializes a vector centrality to store the centrality of each vertex, and then for each vertex s, it performs a breadth-first search to compute the distance and number of shortest paths from s to every other vertex. It then computes the centrality of s by summing the number of shortest paths from s to each other vertex that is one hop away from s and dividing by the total number of shortest paths from s to any other vertex. It stores the resulting centrality in centrality and prints it. Finally, it sorts the vertices by centrality and prints the top three vertices with highest centrality. 
There is also a test module to test that two functions in the code, create_directed_graph and sort_graph_lists. These tests both pass when running my code and ensure that the code is running properly, even with other data. When running the program normally the output is quite quick and displays the top 3 addresses with the most transactions.
